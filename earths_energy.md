# Earth's energy

It is my belief that earth is a type of lower plane designed for demons and monsters and humans are merely a kind of cattle if you will. However its not that simple. Humans are a cattle designed specifically for capturing a higher essence for consumption. Humans are not at the top of the food chain. Specifically the energy created by fear is the main extract for earthbounds(demons and such). Fear draws energy from the lower 3 chakras, earth/root, water, and fire/plexus. I think its also possible to draw the entire tree of chakra through the earth/root chakra, but I'm unsure as my current theory revolves around the lower 3 chakras.
